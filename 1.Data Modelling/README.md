 ## Creating relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of a data consumers. Using ETL to build databases in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.<br>


 ### Project : DATA MODELING WITH POSTGRES <br>
In this project, you’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. You’ll create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL you will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into your new tables. <br>


 ### Project : DATA MODELING WITH APACHE CASSANDRA <br>
In this project, you’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. You’ll create a noSQL database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. You’ll model your data in Apache Cassandra to allow for specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.
